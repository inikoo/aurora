Aurora is a project that is already used in production, but it continues to actively invite maintainers. 
You can help out a high-profile project that is used by real companies in ther day to day operations, gaining invaluable
experience. 
There is plenty of work to do. No big commitment required, if all you do is review a single Pull Request, 
you are part of our team.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing 
and developing this open source project. 
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, 
and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

Spelling / grammar fixes
Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
Comment clean up
Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
Adding logging messages or debugging output

For any other contribution you will need to sing the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with Inikoo Ltd.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@inikoo.com In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. 
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, 
so if you're unsure, just email us at security@inikoo.com.
