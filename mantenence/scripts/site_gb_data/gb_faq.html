<dt>Why is there a minimum order at Ancient Wisdom?</dt>
<dd>The minimum order is in place to protect our retail customer by discouraging the general public. We
 Do try and check company details but some members of the public are quite cunning. Our retail
 Customers understand this and most customers make orders of over £50 and are therefore not  charged.  Gold reward members are not subject to the small order charge.</dd>


<dt>What is the minimum order for Ancient Wisdom ?</dt>
<dd>Minimum order is £50 before VAT and carriage. Any orders under £50 attract a £5 surcharge.
Showroom sales (cash & Carry) - strictly £50+vat minimum order.</dd>


<dt>How much will it cost me to have my order delivered ?</dt>
<dd>Our standard carriage fee is £7.50 per order in the UK. Some areas of the UK such as the Channel
 Islands, Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and some remote parts of Scotland attract an additional fee. If you live in one of these areas we will be happy to give you a quote for carriage before we send your order. Orders over £175 in a an area that has the standard carriage fee will have the carriage fee waived .
For European orders please call us for a quote. Our export manager is Philippe.</dd>


<dt>Do you provide any kind of drop shipping service ?</dt>
<dd>No.</dd>


<dt>Is there any way I can become the only Ancient Wisdom distributor in my town/area ?</dt>
<dd>No. This would be unfair to all those who lost out and impossible to police.</dd>

<dt>My order was over £100 but I did not receive a bottle of wine, where is it ?</dt>
<dd>Please check that it has been less then one month since your last order. If it is more then one month you are no longer a gold reward and do not qualify for a free bottle of wine.</dd>


<dt>I placed my order over the Internet and the total was over £175 but you still charged me carriage.
<dd>To qualify for free carriage your order must be over £175 before VAT and after all discount have been applied .</dd>


<dt>I placed an order on Friday afternoon/evening and did not receive it until Tuesday,  yet you state next day delivery.
<dd>Order placed after 5.30pm will not be processed until the following working day. Ancient Wisdom is closed after 5.30pm and at weekends. We do not deliver at weekends unless specified by the customer at the time of ordering. This also incurs an extra carriage cost payable by the customer.
Please also note that at busy times we do not guarantee next day delivery, especially on orders placed later in the day.</dd>

<dd>We can accept orders from US but it is better if they are high value low weight items so we can send  them by standard mail. Unfortunately carriage costs to the US at this time are very high and would make certain orders very expensive.</dd>

<dt>You sell things in bulk but I only want to buy one item or pack, can I ?</dt>
<dd>No, we sell things in bulk so that we can pass on savings to our customers and keep our prices down. Selling in single units means we will have to start opening packets and boxes, which means we will ruin a whole packet just to sell one item.</dd>
