<div class="block">
Every week for just a week (or until it is gone) we clear out one
product line - simply because:
a) we need the space in our warehouse or we want to promote a line
b) like to spoil our customers
c) it upsets the competition  

Often sold below cost price, so sadly we have to attach some conditions to this offer:
1) Valid only if ordering over Â£150 of other lines (after discounts and before VAT)
2) A maximum quantity per customer (see below)
3) Goods are non-returnable
