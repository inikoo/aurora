<p>
We are always delighted to supply customers around the world, and endeavor to make the process as simple as possible. Our products are often extremely well received outside the UK with customers ordering on a regular basis.  
</p>
<p>
Please keep in mind that weight and volume affect the freight costs. Heavy low value items (like Simmering Granules) are less cost effective than small higher value items (like Essential Oils or Crystals).
</p>
<h3>Minimum Order</h3>
<p>
There is no minimum order, but it is unlikely that orders of less that £100 will be cost effective. Orders over £300 (about 420 Euro’s) can be delivered in Europe SSC (Shipping Stock Covered) which is effectively free. See below.
</p>
<h3>VAT</h3>
<p>
All prices quoted throughout this site are excluding VAT.
EEC customers who, at the time of ordering, provide a valid VAT / EEC Trade Number will not be liable to pay UK VAT currently at 17.5%. If a VAT / EEC Trade Number is not provided then UK VAT is charged. You will notice if ordering
online a box for inputting your tax id number. Please note you may have to pay your countries Customs duty on receipt of the goods.
</p>
<p>
All other customers outside of the EEC do not pay UK VAT. The shopping cart on this site will still calculate it but it will be excluded from your invoice.
</p>
<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>
The ideal method of payment is by credit or debit card. We accept Visa
Master Card, Switch or Solo. We can also accept payment by cheque or direct bank transfer.
</p>

<h3>Freight Costs</h3>
<p>
On orders of less than £175 a charge of £7.50 will appear in the shopping cart. This is for UK only so please ignore it. We will provide a no obligation quote for freight costs for both air and sea before dispatching your order.
</p>
<h3>SSC - Shipping Stock Covered.</h3>
<p>On orders of £300 and over you can opt to have you goods delivered SSC. This can be applied to any European Country, (includes Eire and Northern Island) and may be extended to other countries on request.
Basically whatever the shipping (or freight cost) you have to pay we will give you bonus stock with a retail value that covers this cost.
