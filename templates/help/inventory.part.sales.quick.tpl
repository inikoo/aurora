        <p>
            When a part is packed the status of that transaction (ITF) is updated from  <em>Order in progress (OIP)</em> to  <em>Sale</em>.

        </p>
        <p>
            <em>ITFs</em> with status <em>Sale</em> are used to calculate <em>part</em> sales.
        </p>

            Part sales are updated in the background when the <em>Delivery note DN</em> state is set as <em>Packed and sealed</em>, it can take few seconds for the figures to update.
