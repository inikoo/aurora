There are only a few things that really matter to sales management. Let me present them in order of importance:
<ul>
   <li> How much you're selling (specifically, your last month/quarter).</li>
   <li> The quantity and quality of what's in your sales processes.</li>
   <li> Your sales forecast.</li>
</ul>
