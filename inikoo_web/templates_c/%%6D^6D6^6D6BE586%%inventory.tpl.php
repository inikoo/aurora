Most organizations have an underlying value chain consisting of their key business processes. The value chain identifies the natural, logical flow of an organization's primary activities. For example , in the case of a retailer, the company main issue a purchase order to a product manufacturer. The products are delivered to the retailer's warehouse, where they a re held in  inventory. A delivery is made to a to a individual store, where again the products sits in a inventory until a customer make a purchase. There are variations to this chain like in the case of a online business where  products are dispatched direct from the warehouse to the customers or when manufacurer deliver directly to the retail stores.
