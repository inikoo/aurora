How do you become a Gold Reward member?
It now takes no effort above ordering within 30 days of your last order.
Our computer will auto apply your reward.
</p>

<p>
Order within 30 days to receive a Discount Upgrade ie
maximum discount on all lines regardless of amount ordered (up to 50% discount) and a further bottle of wine! (on orders over £100+vat).
</p>
<p>
Order each month to maintain membership, get maximum discounts and a bottle of wine - without having to worry about order quantities. This means you can replace stock actually sold rather than forever increasing stock levels just to get maximum discounts.
</p>
<p>
Gold reward members also benefit from:
First chance of any major clearance offers.
No small order charge (for orders under £50).
</p>
<p>
